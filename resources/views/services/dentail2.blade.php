    <h1>Game Development <br>and AR/VR</h1>
    <p class="content-1">Incredibly, AR and VR have brought a revolution in the gaming world that was once considered to be impossible. The gaming industry has displayed fast growth in recent years. The gaming industry’s growth is predominated by Smartphone users who spend a maximum number of hours playing the game over phones or new gaming technologies. Globally, it has been assumed that smartphones and the latest technologies have caused a total transformation in the gaming experience.
      Use bleeding-edge technology to bring your imagination to life Creating Beat Saber was an incredible leap of faith for our team. We were essentially stepping into the unknown, unsure if our concept would be successful. Unity was perfect to help us on this journey and we quickly realized that using Unity, we could accomplish anything we wanted - it's remarkably flexible and easy to use. We started by creating a playable prototype and in just a few hours, we knew the possibilities were endless.</p>

    <h1>What is Augmented Reality (AR)?</h1>
    <p class="analytic-1">
      <li>After the introduction of virtual in the real world</li>
      <li>AR came into existence which is a creative and immersive experience that allows users to feel happy after interacting</li>
      <li>Personally with the digital environment</li>
      <li>Augmented reality is a combination of game visuals along with the audio content with respect to the user environment in real-time which helps in the establishment of an artificial environment.</li>
      <li>In the gaming industry, AR is used to create a playing zone within the existing artificial environment.</li>
      <li>The valuation of the augmented reality gaming segment is on the way to achieve the targeted amount of approx $385 billion by 2023.</li>

    <h1>What is Virtual Reality (VR)?</h1>
    <p class="analytic-1">
      Virtual reality (VR) is a technology used to create a simulated environment. Similar to the user interface, VR allows users to experience the best in the artificial world. Users instead of viewing the screen are immersed and able to get involved and interact with the 3D worlds. It stimulates every sense such as vision, hearing, touch, and smell. The computer technology acts as a gatekeeper of the artificial world. Howsoever, everything comes with few limitations in an experience such as availability of content as well as a cheaper range of computing power. The virtual reality major component is the head-mounted display (HMD).

    <h1>VR and AR are the two sides of a coin. </h1>
    <p class="analytic-1">
      Augmented reality imitates artificial things in a real environment whereas VR creates an artificial environment to inhabit. In augmented reality, 3D graphics are used to superimpose the computer-generated images over the user’s view of the real world. This is possible because computers make use of sensors and algorithms to determine the orientation of a camera. Howsoever, in Virtual Reality, the computer makes use of similar senses and algorithms. But, the major difference arises when instead of making use of real cameras within the physical environment, VR technology utilizes the user’s eyes to locate within the imitated environment. This clearly means that, if the user’s head turns then the graphic is going to react accordingly. VR technology offers a convincing and interactive world in which the user responds.

        <p class="analytic-2"><h3>Emerging industry force:</h3> <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>AR and VR are considered to seamlessly offer the most exciting emerging technologies on the planet for today life.</li>
          <li>The industries using the AR and VR technologies are forecasted to achieve the targeted valuation of over $25 billion by 2025.</li>
          <li>Howsoever, AR has occupied a special place in the burgeoning mobile gaming world.</li>
          <li> Near about 50% of global game market apps displays no sign to lift-up as the handset that comes incorporated with the built-in camera which serves as a great source of Augmented Reality gaming.</li>
          <li>In the year 2016, Niantics “Pokemon Go!” game came into existence which represented the watershed moment that displays augmented reality which resulted worldwide into 800 million downloads.</li>
          <li>Users were left to fantasize with the capacity to interact with daily life in a form of bid to capture a number of “monsters” one could discover. </li>
          <li>But, exponential growth has encouraged developers to improve the level of interest offered by both augmented reality and virtual reality.</li>
