    <h1>Mobile Application Development</h1>
    <p class="content-1">The "huge" number of global users using mobile phones to search for information, entertainment, etc. shows the strong development of mobile applications in the digital age. To best meet the ever-changing needs of users, many app development trends have been born and implemented year after year. So what trends have been, are and will be developing mobile apps in 2021? What trends will "explode" this year? Join SoftWorld to explore the problem of mobile app development in Vietnam in the following article!</p>

    <h1>1. What Is Mobile App Development?</h1>
    <p class="analytic-1">
      The process of planning, organizing, financing, and executing mobile applications for use on smartphones is known as mobile app development. These programs can be pre-installed or installed and run later by the user. In addition, they exploit the device's internet connectivity to access computational resources from afar.
    </p> <br>
    <p>
      The mobile app development necessitates software development that can be loaded on a device and allows a background platform for data accessibility via APIs and evaluating the app.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      The firm must also evaluate form factors, technical specifications, and many other facets of the mobile app development while creating universal mobile apps. In addition, with the growing number of mobile app development businesses, entrepreneurs, startups, and developers must have a clear understanding of the system.

    <h1>2. The Goal of a Mobile App</h1>
    <p class="analytic-1">
      Mobile App Development with an ambiguous goal or the inability to adapt to various changes is a waste of resources. Instead, the development of an app should be related to a specific aim. If not completed, the project will be a failure. <br>
      <br> Uncertainty and failure to target the consumer to find a position in the market are the primary causes for a mobile app's downfall. <br>
      <br> There is a lot of competition with the rapid growth of the industry. By 2021, the global mobile app industry is anticipated to be worth $6.3 trillion, with app income predicted to increase by 113% to $188 billion. <br>
      Thus, when it comes to designing a mobile app and making it a success, keep the following goals in mind: <br><br>
      <ul class="mobie_services_2_content" >
        <li><b> Problem Solution:</b> The company should know what issues the software will assist in fixing. The mobile app's problem-solving functionality might be anything, including customer interaction, product purchases, service bookings, and company participation.</li>
        <li><b>Entertainment:</b> Apps with a 'fun' aspect flourish primarily due to their appeal across a broad spectrum of age groups and capacities. This genre includes Angry Birds and Temple Run, which have used this motto to achieve success. They are initially free, with the possibility to upgrade to paid programs later.</li>
        <li><b>Creating Value:</b> Some apps are helpful for everyday tasks such as multi-location conferences. These kinds of apps add value to the consumer. For instance, with Skype, you may share your screen, phone, chat, video conference, among other things.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>3. Mobile App Development Options </h1>
    <p class="analytic-1">
      There are four approaches to go forward with mobile app development which includes:
      <ul class="mobie_services_2_content">
        <li>Develop native mobile apps</li>
        <li>Create native cross-platform mobile apps</li>
        <li>Develop hybrid mobile apps</li>
        <li>Develop progressive web applications</li>
      </ul>
      <br><br>
      No matter what strategy you choose; there are benefits and drawbacks to developing an application. You may accomplish the required user experience, access computational resources, and build native functionality for your application by selecting a method that meets your plan.

  <h1>4. Choose a platform</h1>
  <p class="analytic-1">
    Many independent application development teams choose to build their apps for Android first. Why? The vast majority—around 70 percent—of smartphones run Android, and the Google Play Store has fewer restrictions than the Apple App Store. On the other hand, mobile applications developed for iOS have far fewer devices that need support, making optimization simpler. And user retention is typically higher for iOS applications. <br> <br>
    Depending on the intended use case and target audience for the mobile application you are developing, you might have other considerations. For example, if you’re designing an app for your organization’s employees, you’ll need to support the platforms they use, which may mean developing cross-platform apps that work for both Android and iOS. Or if you’re building a mobile application for your customers and you know the majority of them use iPhones, then developing iOS applications should be a top priority. Additional considerations when developing your mobile applications include monetization strategies and anticipated user behavior, which can be influenced by geographical and cultural factors.

  <br><h1>5. Develop for both Android and iOS: Native apps or hybrid apps?</h1>
  <br><br>
  <img src="{{ URL('Images/native-hybrid-mobile-apps.png') }}">
  <p class="analytic-1">
    Let’s say you need to do mobile application development for both the Android operating system and iOS. What is the best software development approach? <br><br>
    You could develop two native applications. Taking advantage of native APIs and OS-specific programming languages can help you build a powerful app. Most enterprise apps, especially ones that require substantial API traffic, benefit from native development.<br><br>
    If you decide to develop native applications one at a time, you’ll likely want to begin with Android—for some of the same reasons that independent app developers often focus on Android. You’ll probably have better luck developing the full application as an MVP on Android and then converting and optimizing it to iOS after release.<br><br>
    You will still need to debug and rewrite the code for the native language and redesign the front-end user interface, because the two operating systems function very differently, making cross-platform operation impossible.<br><br>
    So why not start completely from scratch? While you can’t simply translate the code into a new programming language, much of the back end can be replicated cross-platform. Frameworks, libraries and third-party extensions often function identically in both environments, allowing you to avoid costly reworking. You can also use a prebuilt mobile cloud service, such as IBM Mobile Foundation, to manage the web back end.<br><br>
    Another option is to go hybrid, taking a write-once-run-anywhere approach. Hybrid apps use a single codebase that can function on either platform. They’re typically coded in a programming language that’s universally recognized, such as Java, JavaScript, HTML or CSS. Because you’re denied access to the operating system’s native APIs, hybrid mobile application development works best for simple web applications—three- or four-page mobile applications with limited functionality.<br><br>

<div class="analytic">
  <h1>Join a developer program</h1>
  <p class="analytic-1">
    Neither Android nor iOS is a completely open environment. Before your application can be officially distributed, you’ll need to join the appropriate developer program.  <br><br>
    The Android mobile application development program lets you use your existing Google account to create a developer account, pay the USD 25 fee and submit your application. Google Play, the official Android store, does have quality standards that must be met prior to publication, but they’re more guidelines than actual rules. As part of your app development process, you can also distribute your applications outside the Google Play store and allow users to directly download and install them.<br><br>
    By contrast, the Apple mobile application development program sets a high barrier to entry. You need to pay a program fee of USD 99 per year and adhere to high standards. Once you’re a member of the program, you get early access to beta versions of the operating systems and proprietary frameworks or APIs. Meeting the high standards for the App Store also signifies to the world that you’ve developed a high-quality app.<br><br>
